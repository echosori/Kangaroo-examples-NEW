# Kangaroo-examples forked from AltamiroAJ's repository.

AltamiroAJ forked and updated Daniel Piker's repository (https://github.com/AltamiroAJ/Kangaroo-examples). However, there are still some minor aspects that aren't entirely new. I am working on updating those, as well as adding new definitions scattered across the Rhino Forum.
